Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course ProjectThis GitHub repository contains the 4 files for the Getting and Cleaning Data course project brief: a README, a Codebook about the data, the R script (so others can ‘reproduce’ the analysis), and the resulting ‘tidy’ dataset.  File descriptions are as follows:- This README.txt that provides an overview,- A CodeBook.md that describes the data and other ‘relevant’ transformations,- The run_analysis.R that follows the given steps:1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.- The TidyData.txt thar contains the ‘processed’ data.The original data is from the “Human Activity Recognition using Smartphones” by Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, and Luca Oneto in 2012. The zip file can be obtained from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
