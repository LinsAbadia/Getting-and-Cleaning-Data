Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
This GitHub repository contains the 4 files for the Getting and Cleaning Data course project brief: a README, a Codebook about the data, the R script (so others can ÔreproduceÕ the analysis), and the resulting ÔtidyÕ dataset.  

File descriptions are as follows:
- This README.txt that provides an overview,
- A CodeBook.Rmd that describes the data and other ÔrelevantÕ transformations,
- The run_analysis.R that follows the given steps (and, hopefully, there are sufficient comments to provide context):
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
- The TidyData.txt thar contains the ÔprocessedÕ data.

The original data is from the ÒHuman Activity Recognition using SmartphonesÓ by Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, and Luca Oneto in 2012. The zip file can be obtained from:
